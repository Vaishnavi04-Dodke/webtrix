<p>The dollar sign is treated as a letter in JavaScript names.</p>
<p>Using the dollar sign is not very common in JavaScript, but professional programmers often use it as an alias for the main function in a JavaScript library.

    In the JavaScript library jQuery, for instance, the main function $ is used to select HTML elements. In jQuery $("p"); means "select all p elements".

let $myMoney = 5;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = $$$ + $myMoney;
